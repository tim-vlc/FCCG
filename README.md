## Finding Connected Components in Graph

This an attempt at implementing [this](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~hkardes/pdfs/ccf.pdf) paper.

The code found is not exhaustive, but it provides scalable code if correclty implemented using GCP or another Cluster Handler.
Dataframes and RDDs were used on different datasets for testing, and the implementations were done both in Scala and Python using Spark.
